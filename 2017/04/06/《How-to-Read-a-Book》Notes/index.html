<h2 id="THE-DIMENSIONS-OF-READING"><a href="#THE-DIMENSIONS-OF-READING" class="headerlink" title="THE DIMENSIONS OF READING"></a>THE DIMENSIONS OF READING</h2><h3 id="1-The-Activity-and-Art-of-Reading"><a href="#1-The-Activity-and-Art-of-Reading" class="headerlink" title="1. The Activity and Art of Reading"></a>1. The Activity and Art of Reading</h3><h5 id="Reading-Actively"><a href="#Reading-Actively" class="headerlink" title="Reading Actively"></a><em>Reading Actively</em></h5><ul>
<li>Like writing, reading is also active like catching the ball. The more <strong>active</strong> you are reading, the better.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Two types of reading: reading for getting information or gaining understanding. The second happens only when: <ol>
<li>the writer has <strong>something better to offer</strong> in a clear form (the good book) and it causes the inequality; </li>
<li>the reader skillfully <strong>overcomes this inequality</strong> and approaches the writer.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="About-Learning"><a href="#About-Learning" class="headerlink" title="About Learning"></a><em>About Learning</em></h5><ul>
<li>Two types of learning: learning by instruction or by discovery. <ol>
<li>Unaided discovery (research) is the art of reading nature and the world; </li>
<li>instruction (aided discovery) is the art of reading books or learning from discourse. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>However, active reading (<strong>being enlightened rather than merely being informed</strong>) also takes serious thinking, keen observation, range of imagination, analysis and reflection, which are needed in research. </li>
<li>Unlike learning from discourse when teachers are present, we must answer the questions ourselves when reading books.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-Four-Levels-of-Reading"><a href="#2-Four-Levels-of-Reading" class="headerlink" title="2. Four Levels of Reading"></a>2. Four Levels of Reading</h3><p><strong>Elementary Reading</strong>: literacy.</p>
<p><strong>Inspectional Reading</strong>: understand the surface (main idea, structure) of the book (often within limited time).</p>
<p><strong>Analytical Reading</strong>: active reading; chewing and digesting; ask many organized questions.</p>
<p><strong>Syntopical Reading</strong>: construct an analysis of the subject that is not in the series of books.</p>
<h3 id="3-Elementary-Reading"><a href="#3-Elementary-Reading" class="headerlink" title="3. Elementary Reading"></a>3. Elementary Reading</h3><p> Four stages to prepare for the first level of reading.</p>
<p> High schools and colleges do not provide necessary education that help students go beyond the first level.</p>
<h3 id="4-Inspectional-Reading"><a href="#4-Inspectional-Reading" class="headerlink" title="4. Inspectional Reading"></a>4. Inspectional Reading</h3><h5 id="First-Part"><a href="#First-Part" class="headerlink" title="First Part"></a><em>First Part</em></h5><ul>
<li>Systematic skimming or pre-reading to see whether the book is worth reading. </li>
<li>Six steps:<ol>
<li>book titles (subtitles)</li>
<li>table of contents</li>
<li>index</li>
<li>blurb</li>
<li>pivotal chapters’ summaries</li>
<li>epilogue, dipping here and there</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Second-Part"><a href="#Second-Part" class="headerlink" title="Second Part"></a><em>Second Part</em></h5><ul>
<li>Superficial reading. Read the book through to the end unstopped by difficult parts or unfamiliar words while getting the main picture of the intention of the writer.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="About-Reading-Speed"><a href="#About-Reading-Speed" class="headerlink" title="About Reading Speed"></a><em>About Reading Speed</em></h5><ul>
<li>Read at <strong>different speed with different books</strong>, different parts of the book and <strong>different goals</strong> in your mind (inspectional or analytical).</li>
<li>Problem of comprehension: speed reading may raise concentration but not <strong>comprehension</strong> which is obtained only during analytical reading.</li>
<li><strong>Every book should be read no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Avoid</strong> fixations and regressions : eyes frequently fixed on phrases and return to phrases or sentences previously read.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-How-to-Be-a-Demanding-Reader"><a href="#5-How-to-Be-a-Demanding-Reader" class="headerlink" title="5. How to Be a Demanding Reader"></a>5. How to Be a Demanding Reader</h3><h5 id="Four-Types-of-Questions"><a href="#Four-Types-of-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Four Types of Questions"></a><em>Four Types of Questions</em></h5><ul>
<li>Essence of reading (the art of reading) is ask four types of questions and  answer them:<ol>
<li><strong>what is the book about on the whole?</strong> (the leading theme and essential subordinate themes or topics)</li>
<li><strong>what is being said in detail, and how?</strong> (discover the main ideas, assertions and arguments)</li>
<li><strong>is the book true, in whole or part?</strong> (make up your own mind)</li>
<li><strong>what of it?</strong> (why does the author thinks it is important, what is further implied and suggested)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Making-Notes"><a href="#Making-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Making Notes"></a><em>Making Notes</em></h5><ul>
<li>Make a book your own: <ol>
<li>marking the book, which is the highest respect you pay the author. </li>
<li>Use whatever is necessary to mark the book, be it asking questions, summing up the author’s points or emphasis important views and phrases. </li>
<li>Use the book’s endpapers wisely and claim the intellectual ownership of the book.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Different noting-making during different types of reading:<ol>
<li>during inspectional reading: structural note-making (what the book is about, the structural order of development)</li>
<li>during analytical reading: conceptual note-making (the truth and significance of the book)</li>
<li>during synoptical reading: dialectical note-making (concerning several books, order and statements and questions about a single subject)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Habit is second nature: learn to read by reading; practice makes perfection; follow the rules.</li>

<li><strong>1st Rule of Analytical Reading</strong>: <strong>classify</strong> a book as fiction or expository works(theoretical and practical by carefully examining the title, preface and the like.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Theoretical-v-s-Practical"><a href="#Theoretical-v-s-Practical" class="headerlink" title="Theoretical v.s. Practical"></a><em>Theoretical v.s. Practical</em></h5><ul>
<li>Theoretical is about pure science, while practical is about applied science, which is what we should do.</li>
<li>Three types of theoretical: <ol>
<li>history: a specific time and a specific place, narrative;</li>
<li>science: seeks laws or generalizations, experimental and depend on elaborate observational researches;</li>
<li>philosophy: seeks general truths.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Science-v-s-Philosophy"><a href="#Science-v-s-Philosophy" class="headerlink" title="Science v.s. Philosophy"></a><em>Science v.s. Philosophy</em></h5><ul>
<li>science: the books talks about or refers to activities beyond normal or routine daily experience</li>
<li>philosophy: normal experience shared by everyone</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-X-raying-a-Book"><a href="#7-X-raying-a-Book" class="headerlink" title="7. X-raying a Book"></a>7. X-raying a Book</h3><ul>
<li><strong>2nd Rule of Analytical Reading</strong>: state the unity (the theme or main point) of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most a few sentences.<ol>
<li>capture the essence of the plot; </li>
<li>make use of the title and the preface; </li>
<li>in expository works, the unity would usually appear in the first paragraph; </li>
<li>for history and fiction, the unity would be a single thread of plot.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>3rd Rule of Analytical Reading</strong>: set forth the <strong>major parts</strong> of the book, and show how these are organized into a whole, by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole.<ol>
<li>Do not have to follow the rule of creating a similar tree structure of the book; do not strictly follow the author’s outline.</li>
<li>But do make your own outline; and look beneath the author’s outline (prefaces, table of contents) to discover the real structure.</li>
<li>The third rule shows how and why of your statement of unity, which is not supported without the third rule.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>4th Rule of Analytical Reading</strong>: find out what the author’s problems (intention) were.</p>
<ol>
<li>figure out the problems the book is trying to solve;</li>
<li>list the answers in an intelligible order and answer them;  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The four rules constitute the first stage of analytical reading. It helps reveal the book’s structure and answer the first type of question: <em>what is the book about on the whole?</em></strong></p>

<li>a word used unambiguously; </li>
<li>a skilled use of words for the sake of communicating knowledge.</li>
</ol>

<li>The two processes, outlining and interpretation meet at the level of propositions and arguments;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>6th Rule of Analytical Reading</strong>: mark the most important sentences in a book and discover the propositions (conclusions and reasons of an argument) they contain.</li>
<li><strong>7th Rule of Analytical Reading</strong>: locate or construct the basic arguments in a book by finding them in the connection of sentences.</li>
<li><strong>8th Rule of Analytical Reading</strong>: find out what the author’s solutions are, what problems are left unsolved and what new problems has been raised.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Reading-Sentences"><a href="#Reading-Sentences" class="headerlink" title="Reading Sentences"></a><em>Reading Sentences</em></h5><ul>

</ol>
</li>
<li>One grammatically simple sentence may contains several propositions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finding the most important sentences:<ol>

<li>instructive (add to knowledge, e.g. the whole is greater than the part)</li>
<li>not instructive (the propositions is contained in the definition of the words, e.g. the father of the father is grandfather)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The above 4 rules comprises the second stage of Analytical Reading. It covers interpretation, from words to propositions and arguments, of the book. It also helps answer the second type of question: <em>what is being said in detail, and how?</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="10-Criticizing-a-Book-Fairly"><a href="#10-Criticizing-a-Book-Fairly" class="headerlink" title="10. Criticizing a Book Fairly"></a>10. Criticizing a Book Fairly</h3><ul>
<li><strong>9th Rule of Analytical Reading</strong>: you must be able to say, with reasonable certainty, “I understand”, before you can say any one of the following things: “I agree,” or “I disgree,” or “I suspend judgement.”</li>
<li><strong>10th Rule of Analytical Reading</strong>: when you disagree, do so reasonably, and not disputatiously or contentiously.</li>
<li><strong>11th Rule of Analytical Reading</strong>: respect the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion, by giving reasons for any critical judgements you make. Matters of knowledge are generally remediable.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="About-Critizing"><a href="#About-Critizing" class="headerlink" title="About Critizing"></a><em>About Critizing</em></h5><ul>
<li>The activity of reading books does not end with understanding. It must be complete by the work of <strong>criticism, the work of judging</strong>.</li>
<li>Criticism is <strong>based on understanding</strong> the contents and <strong>knowing the rules</strong> for criticizing; Where understanding is not present, affirmations and denials are equally meanless and unintelligible.</li>
<li>The role of rhetoric is the end. Grammatical and logical skills are means to this end. Criticism always <strong>comes after the first two stages of analytical reading</strong> has been completed.</li>
<li>Opinions v.s. Knowledge:<ul>
<li>mere (personal) opinions: <strong>unsupported</strong> judgement; </li>
<li>knowledge: consists in those opinions that <strong>can be defended</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-Agreeing-or-Disagreeing-with-an-Author"><a href="#11-Agreeing-or-Disagreeing-with-an-Author" class="headerlink" title="11. Agreeing or Disagreeing with an Author"></a>11. Agreeing or Disagreeing with an Author</h3><ul>
<li>For a controversy to be well conducted, the are three conditions to be satisfied:<ol>
<li>recognize that you are being rational instead of emotional</li>
<li>recognize what your prejudgement (assumptions) are; good controversy should not be a quarrel about assumptions.</li>
<li>read sympathetically and walk in the other’s shoes</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The above conditions are too ideal to be meeted, these <strong>four points are more practical</strong>:<ol>
<li>the author is <strong>uninformed</strong>: the author lacks knowledge that is relevant to the problem; point out the knowledge and show how it makes a difference</li>
<li>the author is <strong>misinformed</strong>: make assertions contrary to facts</li>
<li>the author ise <strong>illogical</strong>; his reasoning is not congent: commit a fallacy in reasoning; two types of fallacy; first, the conclusion does not follow from the reasons; second, two aspects are incompatible</li>
<li>the author’s analysis is <strong>incomplete</strong>: he has not solved the problems he started with, or he did not make a good use of the materials as possible</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The 9th, 10th, 11th and the above four points comprise the third stage of analytical reading. It covers critizing a book as a communication of knowledge. The 9th, 10th, 11th rule disscuss the general maxims of intellectual etiquette, and the four points discuss special criteria for points of criticism. This stage helps you answer the third and the fourth questions: <em>is it true? What of it?</em></strong></p>

<li>concerned with knowledge: epistemology;</li>
<li>concerned with conduct of individual: ethics;</li>
<li>concerned with conduct of individual in relation to the community: political philosophy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Modern and traditional philosophy:<ol>
<li>answer the first-order questions: concerned with what is or happens or what ought to be done; (traditional, for lay readers)</li>
<li>answer the second-order questions: concerned with the content of our thinking when we answer the first-order questions and the ways we express such thoughts in language. (modern, for experts)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Philosophical method: involve little experiments but thinking is not enough without experience; we share common experience with great philosophers; <strong>they think more profoundly about the experience than the rest of us</strong>.</li>
<li>Philosophical styles:<ol>
<li>the philosophical dialsgues; only Plato managed this style;</li>
<li>the philosophical treatise on essay; through straightforward exposition; Aristotle and Kant;</li>
<li>the meeting of objections; debate and discussion; Thomas Aquinas;</li>
<li>the systemization of philosophy; give philosophy certainty and strictly formal structure as of mathematics;</li>

<li>distinguish between abstract and concrete expressions;</li>
<li>refer to the common experience the author mentions and focus on thinking;</li>
<li>read more than one philosophical book about one subject;</li>

<li>Difficulties of reading social science:<ol>
<li>being prevented from analytically reading by your own views of the issue;</li>
<li>though some terms are usually present in social articles, you, or even the authors,  do not know the exact scope of such terms; few books of social science have “stipulation on usage”, which is common in hard science works, such as mathematics and physical;</li>
<li>social science works usually come as a mixed kind of expository writing; they may be a mixture of a large scope of areas including science, history, philosophy and fiction; the mixture shifts between books or even within books;</li>
<li>there is not a great book on a single subject of social science, so there is an urgent need to read multiple books on a single subject.</li>

<h5 id="Syntopical-Reading"><a href="#Syntopical-Reading" class="headerlink" title="Syntopical Reading"></a><em>Syntopical Reading</em></h5><ul>
<li>Five steps of syntopical reading:<ol>
<li><strong>find the relevant passages;</strong> could be done while doing inspectional reading after you have read mant books, which gives you a clear idea of the subject; </li>
<li><strong>bring the authors to terms;</strong> force an author to use <strong>neutral terminology</strong>; avoid being lost in the variety of terms; syntopical reading is an exercise of <strong>translation</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>getting the question clear;</strong> establish a set of neutral propositions; the authors can be interpreted as giving answers to these quetions; frame a set of questions in an order; 1st question deals with the existence or character of phenomenon  we are investigating, further questoins deals with how the phenomenon is known or how the idea manifest itself, final questions deals with the consequences of the answers to these questoins;</li>
<li><strong>defining the issues;</strong> to join the different answers; ranging the authors’ answers to various questions on one side of an issue or another; when the issue is not the author’s primary concern, it should be constructed;</li>
<li><strong>analyzing the discussion;</strong> the truth is probably in the conflict of opposing answers; ask the question in an order and defend that order; ordering the questions and issues by putting the more general ones on the front.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Some Tips:<ol>
<li>Try to achieve dialectical objectivity: <strong>look at all sides and to take no sides</strong>, constantly refer back to the  actual text of the authors.</li>
<li>Syntopicon can help readers read initiatively, suggestively and instructively.</li>
